t = ( P â€“Ro ) DOT N
----------------------
N DOT V
Division by 0 will cause 
a run-time crash.
N DOT V is 0 when the 
ray is parallel to the 
plane so no 
intersection is possible.
If N DOT V is not zero, then we can take our value of t and plug-it into the points along ray equation...
A(t) = Ro + t * V
